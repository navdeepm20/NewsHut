# NewsHut
> NewsReader is a website created to get personalized news experience to its clients. It's not an individual news platform but it's a platform which gathers news from various sources and help you to read news you want. Why googling for a perticular news topic when you have NewsReader. That's the idea behind creating this awesome project and to make news reading more personalized and simple.
